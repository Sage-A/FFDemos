# FFDemos
As a student, the majority of my programs come from class homeworks and projects. For some of these files, I was provided with a list of function signatures to use, but the majority of the code written is original and by me. I've tried to demonstrate a variety of languages but I do not have significant project files for all of the langagues I indicated knowing. For ones not shown here, I completed courses / tutorials but no longer have access to the files created during the learning process. 

Java programs are annotated for JavaDocs and are regular programs. The C# code was written for a Unity project. The C++ code was designed to run on a microprocessor and breadboard circuit.
